## Authors comments to the solution

I generally use try catch in normal all day jobs but for this solution I don't because in my opinion 
Try Catch work best with loggers - but because it's only interview exercise which should show how 
I'm thinking and not how much code I can write I haven't implemented a logger such as Log4Net so I 
didn't bother going into Try Catch.
